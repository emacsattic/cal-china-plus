;;; Commentary:

;; All functions are prefixed with calendar-chinese- unless it is
;; already in cal-china.el; in this case, it is prefixed with
;; calendar-chinese-plus-

;; *NB*: the Chinese calendar date is represented with '(month day
;; nl-year) instead of '(cycle year month day) in the dary file, where
;; nl-year is Nong-Li year offset by constant 2697. For example, Cycle
;; 78 Year 25 is Nong-Li year 4705 but for convenience it is
;; represented as 2008 (i.e. 4705 - 2697) in the diary file.

;; Please send me any comments that you may have. Thank you.
